intro
 <i>Resources</i> are used to configure %p%.  Resources are named items with
 string, integer or Boolean values.
 <p>
 Resource definitions come from the following sources:
 <ul>
 <li>Default values are compiled into %p%.</li>
if x
 <li>Standard X11 methods can be used to override the compiled-in
  defaults.  These methods include:
  <ul>
  <li>The %p% app-defaults file (only if %p% is built with app-defaults
   support).  This can be a locale-specific or generic app-defaults file
   located in the user's home directory or in the system X11 directory.</li>
  <li>Definitions set by the <i>xrdb</i> command.
  <li>The <b>~/.Xdefaults</b> file.
 </ul>
endif
 <li>If a session file <b><i>foo</i>.%p%</b> is specified on the command line,
 its contents are applied.
if x c
 Otherwise, if the %p% profile (<b>~/.%p%pro</b>) exists, it is read and its
 contents are applied.
endif
 These definitions override resource values defined by
if x
 X11 methods and
endif
 compiled-in defaults.</li>
 <li>Command-line options override all other resource definitions.  If more
  than one command-line option sets a resource, the last one is used.</li>
 </ul>
 Many resources have their own command-line switches, which are listed below.
 Those that do not can still be set from the command-line via the <b>-xrm</b>
 command-line option.  For example %-bsdTm% can be set by the
 following command-line option:
 <pre>
     -xrm '%p%.bsdTm: true'
 </pre>
 Note that <b>-xrm</b> is supported on all of the 3270 emulators, not just on
 x3270.

 <h2>Resource File Syntax</h2>
 A resource file
if x
 (app-defaults file, profile or session file)
else
if c
 (profile or session file)
else
 (session file)
endif
endif
 has the following syntax.
 <ul>
  <li>Each definition consists of:
  <pre>
    <b>%p%.</b><i>resource-name</i><b>:</b> <i>value</i>
  </pre></li>
  <li>Comment lines begin with <b>!</b>.</li>
  <li>Line continuation is indicated by a backshash (<b>\</b>) character at
   the end of a line.</li>
if x C
  <li>Multi-line resources, such as keymap definitions, are split with
   newline characters, e.g.:
  <pre>
    <b>%p%.keymap.foo: \
      &lt;Key>a: String("bob") \n\
      &lt;Key>b: String("fred") \n\
      &lt;Key>c: String("joe")</b>
  </pre></li>
endif
 </ul>

name acceptHostname
applies a
type s
groups s
switch -accepthostname
description
    Defines a specific name to accept when validating the name presented in
    the server's SSL certificate, instead of using the name or IP address used
    to make the connection. Takes one of three forms: <b>any</b>, which
    disables name checking, <b>DNS:</b><i>name</i>, which specifies a DNS
    hostname, and <b>IP:</b><i>address</i>, which specifies a numeric IPv4 or
    IPv6 address.
.

name acs
applies c
type b
default true
desc
    When true, %p% will use the curses Alternative Character Set (ACS) to
    display box-drawing characters.
    When false, %p% will use Unicode box-drawing characters.
.

name activeIcon
applies x
groups a
type b
default false
switch -activeicon
description
    When true, %p%'s icon becomes a live miniature of the
    screen display.
.

name aidWait
applies x c s tcl
type b
default false
switch -set aidWait
switch -clear aidWait
desc
    When true, %p% will not block a script after executing
    an AID action (<b>Enter</b>, <b>Clear</b>, <b>PF</b> or <b>PA</b>).
    It is then script's responsibility to poll %p%'s status until it shows
    that the keyboard is no longer unlocked.
.

name allBold
applies c
groups a
type s
default auto
switch -allbold
desc
    When true, %p% will display all text in bold.  This is needed
    for terminals like Linux consoles and xterms that display non-bold text
    in unreadably-dim colors.  When false, text will be displayed in normal or
    bold, depending on the host-specified highlighting attribute.
    <p class=indented>
    When set to <b>auto</b>, it will be assumed <b>true</b> for 3279 emulation,
    and <b>false</b> for 3278 emulation.
.

name allowResize
applies x
type b
default true
description
    When true, the %p% window can be resized by the mouse (actually,
    by the
    window manager).  When false, the window can only be resized from
    menu
    options.  The purpose of disabling mouse resizing is to allow a window
    bigger than will fit on the screen, which some window managers (e.g., mwm)
    will not allow if permitted to resize it.
.

name altCursor
applies x wc
groups a
type b
default false
switch -set altCursor
switch -clear altCursor
option Options -&gt; Toggles -&gt; Underline Cursor
option Options -&gt; Toggles -&gt; Block Cursor
description
    When true, this causes %p% to use the alternate
    (underscore) cursor.  When false, it will use a block cursor.
.

name altScreen
applies c
type s
switch -altscreen
desc
    Defines a character string that will be output to switch the terminal from
    80-column mode to 132-column mode.
    Within the string, the sequence <b>\E</b> is translated to the ASCII
    ESC character (0x1b).
    <p class=indented>
    When %-model% is 5, and this and
    %-defScreen% are defined, %p% will automatically change the
    terminal size when the host switches between the default (24x80) screen
    and the alternate (27x132) screen.
.

name aplCircledAlpha
applies x
groups a
type b
default false
description
    When set to true, allows %p% to work properly with special APL fonts like
    the APL385 font.
    APL385 maps the APL underscored alphabetic characters, which have no
    Unicode equivalent, to the DBCS circled alphabetic characters in the range
    U+24B6 to U+25CF.
    Otherwise, the only way to display these characters is with one of the
    special 3270 fonts included with %p%.
    <p class=indented>
    Because this mapping is non-standard, this setting affects only the
    display. The <b>Ascii</b> action will always output underscored alphabetics
    as blanks, and copy-and-paste operations will also represent them this way,
    though this may change to use the Unicode Combining Low Line character
    U+0332 at some point.
.

name aplMode
applies x
type b
default false
switch -apl
desc
    Enables %p% APL mode.  APL mode appends <b>apl</b> to the list of names
    in %-keymap% (causing the <b>Alt</b> key plus many alphanumeric keys to
    produce basic APL symbols), sets %-composeMap% to <b>apl</b> (allowing
    <b>Compose</b> key sequences to construct complex APL symbols), and sets
    %-charset% to <b>apl</b> (allowing the display of APL symbols using
    several of the 3270 fonts).
.

name asciiBoxDraw
applies C
type b
default false
desc
    When true, this causes box-drawing characters (the Unicode 2500 block) to
    be drawn with ASCII-art characters (<b>+</b>, <b>-</b> and <b>|</b>).
    This allows a readable representation of these characters on the screen
    when using fonts that do not include them or have them with the wrong
    width.
.

name autoShortcut
applies wc
type b
default false
switch -S
switch +S
desc
    When true, %p% will run in <i>auto-shortcut</i> mode.  In auto-shortcut
    mode, %p% automatically creates a desktop shortcut (<b>.lnk</b> file)
    in %TEMP% that is compatible with its session file, then starts it.  This
    ensures that the console window's screen size, character set, font, etc.
    will be correct.
    <p class="indented">
    Auto-shortcut mode requires the use of a session file; the session file
    must have been created by the Session Wizard (release 3.3.9 or later) and
    must not have been modified incorrectly.  All desktop shortcuts created
    by the Session Wizard release 3.3.10 or later include setting autoShortcut
    to true.
    <p class="indented">
    The <b>+S</b> command-line switch turns off auto-shortcut mode.  All
    desktop shortcuts created by the Session Wizard release 3.3.10 or later
    include this switch.
    <p class="indented">
    Auto-shortcut mode does not work on Windows 9x.
.

name background

default white
switch -bg
switch -rv
description
    The background color for menus, buttons, and on monochrome X11 displays, the
    emulator window.
.

name bellMode
applies wc
type s
groups i
description
    Controls how %p% responds to an ALARM WCC or BELL character.
    The value of <b>beepFlash</b> causes both the Windows console to
    beep and the %p% window to flash; this is the default behavior.
    The values of <b>beep</b> and <b>flash</b> cause just the beep and just
    the window flash respectively.  The value <b>none</b> causes ALARM WCCs
    and BELL characters to be ignored.
    <p class="indented">
    If this resource is defined, it overrides %-visualBell%.
.

name bellVolume
applies x
type i
default 0
description
    Controls the volume used when ringing the terminal bell.  The value
    ranges from -100 (silent) through 0 (normal) to +100 (loud).  Not all
    X11 servers can vary the bell volume, other than turning it on and off.
    This resource can be overridden by %-visualBell%, which
    if true, will replace the bell with a flash of the screen.
.

name bindLimit
applies a
groups p
type b
default true
description
    When true, %p% will restrict its screen dimensions to those specified in
    the BIND image sent by the host.
    If false, it will not.
.

name bindUnlock
applies a
type b
groups p
default false
description
    When true, %p% will unlock the keyboard as soon as the host sends a BIND
    image. Otherwise, it will wait until the host sends a Write command.
    <p class=indented>
    Note that in some previous releases, unlocking as soon as the BIND image
    was recevied was the default, and this behavior could be overridden
    (forcing %p% to wait for the Write) by the <b>B:</b> option on the
    hostname. Since waiting for the Write is now the default, <b>B:</b> is
    still supported as a no-op.
.

name blankFill
applies a
groups i
type b
default false
option Options -&gt; Toggles -&gt; Blank Fill
switch -set blankFill
switch -clear blankFill
description
    When true, in 3270 mode %p% will automatically convert
    trailing blanks in a field to NULLs in order to insert a character, and will
    automatically convert leading NULLs to blanks so that input data is not
    squeezed to the left.  This works around some of the quirkier behavior of
    real 3270 terminals.
.

name boldColor
applies x
groups a
default green
type s
description
    This resource defines the X11 color used to display intensified text in
    3278 mode.
    <p class=indented>
    Previous versions of %p% implemented something called <i>pseudo-color
    mode</i>, where a monochrome (3278) terminal was emulated with various
    colors assigned to different kinds of fields.
    To emulate pseudo-color mode with the current version of %p%, select 3278
    emulation with %-model%, set %-inputColor% to <b>orange</b> and set
    %-boldColor% to <b>cyan</b>.
.

name bsdTm
applies a
groups p
type b
default false
description
    Defines %p%'s response to the TELNET DO TIMING MARK option.  When set
    to false, %p% will respond to DO TIMING MARK with
    WONT
    TIMING MARK, which is consistent with most modern TELNET clients.  When
    true, %p% will respond with WILL TIMING MARK, which is consistent
    with the old BSD <i>telnet</i> command and with previous versions of
    %p%.  In either case, %p% will never respond to a DONT TIMING MARK option.
.

name caDir

description
    Defines a directory containing CA (root) certificates, used to validate
    a certificate presented by the host during SSL negotiation.
if w
    There is no default directory. The default is to use the file
    <tt>root_certs.txt</tt> in in the wc3270 install directory.

.

name cbreak
applies c
type b
default false
switch -cbreak
desc
    If true, %p% will set up the terminal in <b>cbreak</b> mode
    instead of the default <b>raw</b> mode.  <b>Cbreak</b> mode enables
    flow-control processing in the TTY driver, and may be required for
    certain terminals that use flow control to avoid dropping characters.
.

name certFile
applies a
groups s
type s
switch -certfile
desc
    Gives the name of a certificate file, provided to the host if requested
    during SSL negotiation.
    The default file format is PEM; it can be overridden by %-certFileType%.
    The private key for the certificate is specified by %-keyFile%.
    If %-chainFile% is specified, it overrides %-certFile%.
.

name certFileType

description
    If true, %p% will respond to a Query(Color) with a list of 8
    supported colors.  If false, it will send a list
    of 16 colors.  The 8-color setting is required for some hosts which
    abort a session if 16 colors are reported.
if c
    <p class=indented>
    This setting will also cause %p% to assume that the terminal supports

    [<i>address</i>:]<i>port</i>, where <i>address</i> is an IPv4 or IPv6
    address such as <b>127.0.0.1</b> or <b>0.0.0.0</b>, and <i>port</i> is a
    TCP port such as <b>4080</b>. The address can also be specified as <b>*</b>
    to indicate <b>0.0.0.0</b>. A numeric IPv6 address must be enclosed in
    square brackets, e.g., <b>[1234:5678::3]</b>, to avoid ambiguity between
    the colons inside the address and the colon separating the address from the
    port. If no address is specified, it defaults to <b>127.0.0.1</b>.
.

description
    When %-idleCommand% is defined, it specifies a command to execute after a
    period of keyboard inactivity (no AID keys pressed).
    The %-idleCommand% can be an arbitrary sequence of %p% actions, but it
    should include an action which generates an AID (<b>Enter</b>, <b>Clear</b>,
    <b>PF</b> or <b>PA</b>).
    %-idleCommandEnabled% must be true in order for the
    %-idleCommand% to take effect. (This is so an idle command can be defined,
    but needs to be enabled explicitly at some point after login.)
    %-idleTimeout% specifies the inactivity interval.
.

name idleCommandEnabled

description
    This resource defines the color used to display light-pen selectable

    <p class=indented>
    Previous versions of %p% implemented something called <i>pseudo-color
    mode</i>, where a monochrome (3278) terminal was emulated with various
    colors assigned to different kinds of fields.
    To emulate pseudo-color mode with the current version of %p%, select 3278

    when Shift, Alt, Ctrl or Meta is pressed, the high-numbered keys appear.
    With this resource true, that is reversed.
.

name keyFile
applies a

type s
switch -keyfile
desc
    Gives the name of a file containg the private key for the certificate
    specified by %-certFile% or %-chainFile%.  The default file type is PEM;
    it can be overridden by %-keyFileType%.  If the private key is encrypted,

desc
    Defines the height of the keys on the pop-up keypad.
.

name keymap
applies x C
groups c
type s
switch -keymap
description
    The name of the keyboard map to use.
    It can be a single keymap name or a comma-separated list of keymaps,
    which will be applied in order.
    <p class=indented>
    Each keymap can optionally be defined in three separate parts: a common
    keymap, which is applied at all times, an NVT-mode keymap, which is
    applied only in NVT mode, and a 3270-mode keymap, which is only applied
    in 3270 mode.
    The NVT-mode keymap has the same name as the common keymap, with the
    suffix <b>.nvt</b> appended.
    The 3270-mode keymap has the suffix <b>.3270</b> appended.
    Thus specifying a %-keymap% value of <i>foo</i> implies the use of
    three different keymaps (if found): <b>foo</b>, <b>foo.nvt</b> and
    <b>foo.3270</b>.
if x
    <p class=indented>
    After that, the string <b>.user</b>
    is appended to the keymap name and three more keymaps are searched
    for: <b>foo.user</b>, <b>foo.user.nvt</b> and <b>foo.user.3270</b>,
    for a total of six.
endif
    <p class=indented>
if x
    If no %-keymap% is defined, the environment variables $KEYMAP and
    $KEYBD are checked, in that order, for the name.
    %-keymap% is only the name; the keymap definition for name
    <i>foo</i> is the resource %-keymap.<i>foo</i>%.
endif
if C
    %-keymap% is only the name; the actual keymap for name
    <i>foo</i> can be defined either by the resource %-keymap.<i>foo</i>%, or
    by a
    <i>keymap file</i>.
if c
    The keymap file is not searched for in any particular
    location, nor does it have a special suffix, so %-keymap% can specify the
    full pathname of the keymap file.
else
    Keymap files are located in the wc3270 documents directory
    (usually <b>My Documents\wc3270</b>)
    and have the suffix <b>.wc3270km</b>.
endif
endif

    When set to the default of false, clicking the left mouse button without a
    modifier will move the cursor or highlight an area for copy and paste.
    Clicking the left mouse button with Alt pressed will cause a lightpen
    select operation at the screen location where the mouse cursor is (it will
    not move the 3270 cursor).
    <p class=indented>
    When set to true, these are reversed. The left mouse button without a

    When true, the <b>Paste</b> action will overlay protected fields,
    instead of locking the keyboard and stopping. This means that when the
    cursor is on a protected field, a displayable character read from the paste
    buffer will simply cause the cursor to advance to the right; the actual
    character is ignored. This allows regions of the screen that include
    protected fields to be copied and pasted back into a formatted screens that
    include the same protected fields (i.e., a form).

    When %p% sends the host an AID (the <b>Enter</b>, <b>Clear</b>, <b>PF</b>
    or <b>PA</b>
    actions), it locks the keyboard until the host sends a reply to
    unlock it.  Some hosts unlock the keyboard before they are actually
    finished processing the command, which can cause scripts to malfunction
    subtly.  To avoid this, %p% implements a hack to briefly delay actually
    unlocking the keyboard.
    When %-unlockDelay% is true, the keyboard unlock
    will be delayed for %-unlockDelayMs% milliseconds.  Setting it to
    false removes this delay, except when executing a macro.
.

name unlockDelayMs
applies a
type i
default 350
desc
    Overrides the default value for the unlock delay (the delay between the
    host unlocking the keyboard and %p% actually performing the unlock).
    The value is in milliseconds; use 0 to turn off the delay completely,
    including for macros.

    When connected in line-at-a-time mode (when %p%
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host), entering
    this character at the keyboard erases the last word of input.
    <p class=indented>
    When connected in character-at-a-time mode (when %p% sends each
    keystroke to the host), this is the ASCII character that is sent to
    the host by the <b>DeleteWord</b> action.
