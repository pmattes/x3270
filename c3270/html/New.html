<h1>New Features in c3270 3.3
<hr width="100%"></h1>
c3270 3.3 is the current development line for c3270.
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.7, 25. December 2007</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li><b>c3270</b> will now display characters such as
      the <i>notsign</i> <b>&#172;</b> properly in terminal windows in UTF-8
      locales.
      Note that this display support requires an <i>ncurses</i> or
      <i>curses</i> library that supports wide characters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added UTF-8 support.  If the current locale specifies UTF-8 encoding,
      then all text output (trace data, script interactions, screen snapshots,
      etc.) will be UTF-8 encoded, and all text input (arguments to the
      <b>Key</b> and <b>String</b> actions, etc.) must be UTF-8 encoded.
      In addition, the NVT-mode xterm/VT100 emulator will expect UTF-8.</li>
      <li>Added display of the host code page and locale codeset to the
       <b>show status</b> command.</li>
      <li>Added support for changing the color mappings.  The curses color
       for a given host color can be specified with the resource
       <b>c3270.cursesColorForHostColor<i>n</i></b>, where <i>n</i> is a
       host color number (0 through 15), and the value of the resource is a
       curses color number (0 through 7).
       <br>In addition, the field-attribute-based colors used when the host
       does not specify a particular color can be changed via the following
       resources:
       <pre>
c3270.cursesColorForDefault
c3270.cursesColorForIntensified
c3270.cursesColorForProtected
c3270.cursesColorForProtectedIntensified
       </pre>
       The value for each of these is a curses color number (0 through 7).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.6, 23. June 2007</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>The code now builds with ICU 3.6.</li>
      <li>Got local process (<b>-e</b>) support to work again.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>-mono -allbold</b> mode.</li>
      <li><b>c3270</b> now paints the entire screen, not just the areas it
      intends to use, so there are no uninitialized regions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for IBM Code Page 1047 (<b>-charset cp1047</b>).</li>
      <li>Added proxy support via the <b>-proxy</b> option or the <b>proxy</b>
      resource.</li>
      <li>Added support for the 3270 background color attribute.</li>
      <li>Added more mappings to the 3270 default keymap (<b>IC</b> -&gt;
      <b>ToggleInsert</b>, <b>Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;U</b> -&gt; <b>DeleteField</b>,
      etc.).</li>
      <li>Modified <i>Blank Fill</i> mode to treat trailing underscore
      chararacters ('<b>_</b>') like blanks when checking for input
      overflow.</li>
      <li>Like <b>x3270</b> and <b>wc3270</b>, <b>-model 3278</b> now
      specifies a green-screen 3278 (if the terminal supports color), and
      like <b>x3270</b>, <b>-mono</b> specifies that any color capabilities
      reported by the terminal should be ignored.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.5, 1. February 2007</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Allow the use of ICU version 3.0 or greater.</li>
      <li>Fixed a scripting hang when the host disconnects during
       <b>Wait(output)</b>).</li>
      <li>Turned the <b>unlockDelay</b> option back on by default.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem where <b>unlockDelay</b> could result in the
       keyboard never unlocking, if the host unlocked the keyboard
       often enough.</li>
      <li>Added a workaround for very old <i>snprintf</i>()
       implementations.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem with the <i>Wait</i> action in the expect glue.
      (Thanks to Jason Howk for the fix.)</li>
      <li>Enlarged the input buffer in x3270if. (Thanks to Igor Klingen for the fix.)</li>
      <li>Fixed a SIGCHLD handler issue on AIX.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem with CR/LF translation on ASCII file transfers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added a <b>-socket</b> option to x3270, s3270 and c3270 to allow a
        script to connect to a Unix-domain socket to control the emulator, and
        added a <b>-p</b> option to x3270if to connect to the socket.</li>
      <li>Added optional support for <b>plugins</b>, with a first plugin to
        implement command history on VM/CMS and TSO hosts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.4, 10. April 2005</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>The code once again builds on Cygwin and other systems not supporting
       IPv6.</li>
      <li>Removed spurious 'no child' error messages from pr3287 on some
       systems.</li>
      <li>Removed unintended blank-line suppression from the output of
       <b>PrintText html string</b>.</li>
      <li>Restored the automatic keyboard unlock delay when processing a
       macro or string.  This allows macros and strings with embedded AID
       sequences to work with hosts that unlock the keyboard before they
       finish processing a command.  Scripts are presumed to be able to
       figure out when the host is finished, or can set the <b>unlockDelay</b>
       resource to <b>true</b> get the delay all the time.</li>
      <li>Fixed an apparent hang (actually just extreme slowness) when the
       host sends a message larger than 4 Kbytes on an SSL tunnel.</li>
      <li>Removed spurious 'Wait timed out' errors in the <b>Wait</b>
       action.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
     <li>Added a newer, more flexible version of Don Russell's RPQNAMES
      support.</li>
     <li>Added support for IPv6.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.3b2, 1. February 2005</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a crash when a login macro is used in NVT mode or when the
       host un-negotiates TN3270E mode.</li>
      <li>Temporarily disabled the RPQNAMES Query Reply.  It was causing IBM
       QMF to crash.  It can be re-enabled by adding <b>#define X3270_RPQNAMES
       1</b> to <b>conf.h</b>.  Hopefully a proper fix can be found shortly.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.3, 31. December 2004</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed the <b>Transfer()</b> action, which didn't work at all.</li>
      <li>Fixed the default primary/alternate screen size (it was alternate,
       it's supposed to be primary).</li>
      <li>Fixed c3270 color support with ncurses and 80/132 screen-size
       switching.
       Sometimes only one of the screen sizes had color.</li>
      <li>Fixed the output of NVT-mode ANSI line-drawing characters in the
       <b>Ascii()</b> scripting action.
       These were formerly all output as blanks; now they are output in
       the same was as x3270 3.2.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>make depend</b>.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>x3270_glue.expect</b>, which got confused when there was
       a whitespace-delimited double-quote in the emulator output.</li>
      <li>Fixed a scripting hang when an UNBIND command arrived while an AID
       was pending.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem with the incomplete processing of a NULLing Program
       Tab order, which could leave formatting artifacts on the screen.</li>
      <li>Removed &lt;subchar1&gt; clauses in two of the <b>.ucm</b> files
       that prevents later versions of ICU's <b>makeconv</b> from accepting
       them, and removed DOS carriage-return characters from the CP837
       <b>.ucm</b> file.</li>
      <li>Corrected some DFT-mode file upload problems: corrected the data
       length, and corrected an empty-buffer problem when the file size was
       an even multiple of the buffer size.</li>
      <li>Corrected a DBCS conversion problem with ICU 3.0.</li>
      <li>Added variable buffer-size support to DFT file transfers.</li>
      <li>Corrected a line-drawing character bug in c3270.</li>
      <li>Fixed a buffer overflow problem in the <b>ReadBuffer</b> action.</li>
      <li>Fixed garbage characters generated for APL data by the <b>Ascii</b>
       and <b>ReadBuffer</b> actions.</li>
      <li>Allow 0 timeouts in <b>Wait</b> actions.</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
     <li>Added Don Russell's RPQNAMES support.</li>
     <li>Removed Minolta-copyrighted code, because of licensing problems.</li>
     <li>Added an <b>aidWait</b> toggle to allow AID actions (<b>Clear</b>,
      <b>Enter</b>, <b>PA</b> and <b>PF</b>) to complete immediately without
      waiting for the host to unlock the keyboard, and a <b>Wait(Unlock)</b>
      action action to block a script until the keyboard is unlocked,
      regardless of the state of the new toggle.</li>
     <li>Turned off the old scripting hack the delayed actually unlocking the
      keyboard for 50ms after the host says we can unlock it.  Added a
      <b>unlockDelay</b> resource, which can be set to <b>true</b> to turn
      it back on.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>dftBufferSize</b> resource to set the default DFT
      buffer size.</li>
     <li>Added options to the PrintText action to save to a file, to save HTML,
      and to return the text as script data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.2, 1. December 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
   <ul>
    <li>Made <b>configure</b> more robust when it can't find one or the other
     of <b>libncurses</b> or <b>ncurses.h</b>.</li>
    <li>Got automatic pr3287 start-up (<b>-printlu</b>) working again.</li>
    <li>Corrected a problem in <b>x3270_glue.expect</b>, which caused
     Tcl syntax errors if a string began with a dash. <i>Thanks to David
     Taylor for the fix.</i></li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
   <ul>
    <li>Error messages are now written to the trace file.</li>
    <li>The response to the TELNET TIMING MARK option has been changed to
     make it compatible with the majority of TELNET clients.
     The response to DO TIMING MARK is now WONT TIMING MARK.
     To restore the previous behavior (responding with WILL TIMING MARK,
     originally derived from the BSD TELNET client), set the resource
     <b>x3270.bsdTm</b> to <b>true</b>.
   </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.1alpha10, 7. September 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
   <ul>
    <li>Made nondisplay fields invisible to the <b>Ascii()</b> action.</li>
    <li>Corrected start-field values at the beginning of data stream traces
     and in the 3270 Read Buffer response.</li>
    <li>Corrected a tight loop in the macro error cancellation logic.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
   <ul>
    <li>Added a <b>ReadBuffer()</b> action to dump the entire contents of
     the 3270 buffer, including field attributes and extended attributes.</li>
    <li>Added a <b>suppressActions</b> resource, a list of the names of
     actions to disable.  This is primarily for controlled environments where
     the user does not have access to the <b>c3270</b> command line, but can
     edit keymap definitions.</li>
    <li>Added a <b>Setverbose</b> function to <tt>x3270_glue.expect</tt>
     to allow verbosity to be changed on the fly.

   </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
   <ul>
    <li>Removed the concept of 'per-host' resources.  Use profiles for
     this.</li>
    <li>Fixed idle commands.  They were pretty much hopeless in 3.3.1alpha8
     and 3.2.20.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in processing the Modify Field order, which would cause
     the character set attribute for the field to be accidentally reset to
     the default.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
   <ul>
    <li>The TELNET START-TLS option is now supported.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <li>3270-specific and NVT-mode-specific keymaps (e.g., keymap.base.3270)
are no longer ignored.</li>
    <li>When there is an ambiguous multi-character match in a keymap, the
correct matching keymap entry is now displayed in the keyboard event trace
file.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Builds cleanly on Linux with <tt>-Wall -ansi -pedantic</tt>.</li>
    <li>Builds without OpenSSL libraries being present.</li>
    <li>Correctly records Field Attributes in the initial screen snapshot
