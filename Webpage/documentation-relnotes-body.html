<h1>Changes in x3270, c3270, wc3270, s3270, ws3270, tcl3270, pr3287 and wpr3287 3.5</h1>
3.5 is the current development line for the x3270 suite.
<h2>Changes in version 3.5ga8, 9. May 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed the toggle names saved with the <b>File->Save Changed
  Options</b> menu option and when processing the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF
  message.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Explicitly test for X11, Xt, Xmu and Xaw header files and
  libraries in the configure script.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Put the <i>dryrun</i> script in the object directory.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Allow Windows VKey codes to be specified in wc3270 keymaps
  in hexadecimal with the syntax <b>VKEY-0x<i>nn</i></b>. This allows unknown
  VKeys to be specified. The same syntax is used in traces.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed an issue where parameters beyond the second
  were ignored in many keymap actions.</li>
 <li>[all] Fixed an issue with the Abort action called from scripts.</li>
 <li>[all Windows] Always find root_certs.txt in the same directory as the
  executable, if not installed.</li>
 <li>[all] Validate the parameters to the Transfer() action better.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>] Fix the configure script so it properly detects
  missing OpenSSL header files, even if the OpenSSL library is present.</li>
 <li>[all] Limit DFT buffer size to 32767. 32768 causes the host to send 0-byte
  buffers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.5beta7, 8. March 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Fixed a crash in the Session Wizard.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.5beta6, 25. February 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>, <i>ws3270</i>] Fixed a problem that broke SSL.</li>
 <li>[all] Added <b>swedish</b> and <b>swedish-euro</b> as aliases for host
  code pages 278 and 1143 respectively.</li>
 <li>[all] Changed the keyboard unlock behavior when a BIND-IMAGE is received
  from the host. Prior to release 3.3.14, the keyboard would not be unlocked
  on a new host connection until a Write was received. In 3.3.14, this was
  changed so that the keyboard would be unlocked as soon as a BIND-IMAGE was
  received, and in release 3.4, a new host option (<b>B:</b>) was added to
  revert to the old behavior. In this release, the old behavior (waiting for
  a Write) is the default again. A new resource, <b>bindUnock</b> is added to
  enable the new behavior (unlocking as soon as the BIND-IMAGE is received)
  when set to true. The <b>B:</b> host option is still supported, as a no-op.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.5beta5, 15. February 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added crosshair cursor and cursor type to the Session
  Wizard.</li>
 <li>[all] Added a <b>-connectimeout</b> option and a <b>connectTimeout</b>
  resource to specify a shorter timeout for the host connection to complete.
  </li>
 <li>[all Windows] Simplified the installer, removing the option of doing a
  per-user install.</li>
 <li>[all Windows] Got rid of the wc3270 Application Data directory. The root
  certificates file is now in the installation directory. ws3270 and wpr3287
  trace files now go into the current directory by default. Session files and
  keymaps are now stored in the <b>My Documents\wc3270</b> folder. When wc3270
  is installed, an Upgrade Wizard will automatically copy existing session
  files and keymaps to the new location. (The old files will be preserved, but
  ignored.)</li>
  <li>[all] Made the EraseEOF, Insert, ToggleInsert, Home, FieldEnd and
   EraseInput actions clear the insert overflow condition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.5alpha4, 15. January 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>s3270</i>, <i>ws3270</i>] Added a <b>-minversion</b> option and
  <b>minVersion</b> resource to specify a minimum required version. If the
  emulator is running an earlier version, it will abort.</li>
 <li>[all] Object files (but not yet documentation) are now built in a separate
  <b>obj</b> directory with machine-specific subdirectories. Both 32- and
  64-bit Windows binaries are always built.</li>
 <li>[all Windows] 64-bit executables are now installed on 64-bit Windows
  systems. Note that upgrades from 32-bit to 64-bit wc3270 require uninstalling
  the 32-bit version first. The installer offers to do this automatically. Note
  also that downgrading from a 64-bit version to an older 32-bit version,
  without first manually uninstalling the 64-bit version, will cause a mess:
  duplicate versions of wc3270 will be listed in <i>Add or Remove Programs</i>,
  and uninstalling one of them will half uninstall the other.<br>
  There are also now 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the no-install ZIP
  file.</li>
 <li>[all Windows] OpenSSL 64-bit now builds cleanly on Visual Studio.</li>
 <li>[all Windows] Fixed a heap corruption crash when the OpenSSL libraries
  are found (even if a secure connections is not in use).</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Dropped support for xmkmf and imake. x3270 builds and
  installs only using autoconf paths now.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.5alpha3, 11. January 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added <b>SelectLeft</b>, <b>SelectRight</b>,
  <b>SelectUp</b> and <b>SelectDown</b> actions to extend the selection area
  with shifted cursor keys. Remapped <b>NextWord</b> and <b>PreviousWord</b> to
  <b>Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;RIGHT</b> and <b>Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;LEFT</b> respectively.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added a selection indicator to the window title.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.5alpha2, 1. January 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Fixed Visual Studio 2013 build issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.5alpha2, 1. January 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] The timeout for <b>Wait</b> can now be specified as a floating-point
  number to wait for fractions of a second.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Improved resize logic. Window maximize now does something
  sensible. Added a Snap Window Size menu option.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added support for the <b>altCursor</b> toggle, which
  if set, changes wc3270 to use an underscore cursor instead of a block
  cursor.</li>
 <li>[<i>s3270</i>] Fixed an x3270if build problem when libiconv is needed,
  plus a build issue that crept in with Makefile.in rationalization.</li>
 <li>[all] Added the <b>scriptPortOnce</b> resource and the
  <b>-scriptportoncde</b> command-line option to allow only one scripting
  connection, after which the emulator will exit.</li>
 <li>[all] Removed arbitrary restrictions on the length of script command lines
  and on the number of arguments per command.</li>
 <li>[all] Allow scripts to issue multiple commands per line.</li>
 <li>[all] Synchronize the <b>ReadBuffer</b> action with the
  <b>Wait(Output)</b> action, just like <b>Ascii</b> and <b>Ebcdic</b>.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>, <i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Added support for a
  <b>crosshairColor</b> resource to allow the color of the crosshair cursor to
  be changed. The value is a host color name or index.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.5alpha1, 10. July 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Changed the crosshair cursor to a thin purple line, instead
  of a reverse-video bar. Extended it into the alternate screen area (if in
  primary mode) and into the OIA.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Added support for a crosshair cursor, using
  the <b>crosshair</b> toggle.</li>
 <li>[all] Added missing attributes to the ReadBuffer action's output
  (background color and input ocntrol) and combined multiple SA orders in
  the same buffer location into a single SA order.</li>
 <li>[all Windows] Added support for compiling 64-bit Windows executables in
  Visual Studio. Switched from VS 2010 to VS 2013. Removed the old nmake
  makefiles (use msbuild now for command-line builds).</li>
 <li>[all Windows] Switched to the mingw-w64 compiler on Linux and Cygwin.
  Made the necessary changes to allow compiling 64-bit Windows executables on
  Linux. To build for 64-bit, set the variable WIN64. 32-bit is still the
  default.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4ga11, Nn. Month 2016</h2>
 <li>[all] Limit DFT buffer size to 32767. 32768 causes the host to send 0-byte
  buffers.</li>
 <li>[all] Allow VS2010 builds with spaces in pathnames.</li>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4ga10, 1. January 2016</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Changed scripts to use /usr/bin/env.</li>
 <li>[all] Suspend the idle command while a file transfer is in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4ga9, 23. October 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Fixed binary file transfer bug.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed missing 'Not Connected' message when disconnecting
  from a host.</li>
  <li>[all] Fixed trace display of incoming IPv6 connections and the parsing of
  the x3270 <b>-scriptport</b> option.</li>
 <li>[<i>tcl3270</i>] Added tcl3270 support for Tcl 8.6.</li>
 <li>[all] Renamed $INSTALL variable in the top-level configure script
  (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/x3270/bugs/15/">bugs:15</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4ga8, 18. September 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed a crash in the Configure Idle Command pop-up.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed an issue with overwriting local files in file
  transfers.</li>
 <li>[<i>s3270</i>] Fixed an x3270if build problem when libiconv is needed.
  </li>
 <li>[all] Fixed a problem with truncating the list of LUs when connecting to
  a host.</li>
 <li>[all] Fixed a crash when too many parameters are passed to an action in a
  macro or script.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4ga7, 28. August 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a number of warnings found by the MacOS C compiler, which turned
  out to be real issues.</li>
 <li>[all] Synchronize the <b>ReadBuffer</b> action with the
  <b>Wait(Output)</b> action, just like <b>Ascii</b> and <b>Ebcdic</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4ga6, 10. August 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Fixed an NVT-mode emulation problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4ga5, 10. July 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Fixed a synchronization issue with scripts and file transfers.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Fixed a crash when the Transfer action was
  called from a script.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed a crash when visible control characters are turned on
  in 3278 mode.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>] Changed the pr3287 Makefile to use $INSTALL_DATA
  (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/x3270/bugs/13">bugs:#13</a>).</li>
 <li>[All Unix] Added -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE wherever a Makefile used -D_BSD_SOURCE,
  to get rid of compiler warnings with newer versions of glibc
 (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/x3270/bugs/12">bugs:#12</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4ga4, 16. June 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>, <i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Corrected the OIA display of
  save-to-printer pages.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Made the help for file-transfer reflect
  the current defaults. Added help for <b>Keymap</b>.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Fixed the pager at the wc3270&gt; prompt. Now it adapts
  to the size of the console window correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4beta3, 28. May 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Fixed a problem with printer session
  start-up when both a specific printer LU and an SSL tunnel (L:) are
  specified.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4alpha2, 15. May 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Added a <b>Keymap</b> action to add or
  remove temporary keymaps. The semantics are the same as the x3270 action of
  the same name.</i></li>
 <li>[all] Made the parameter to <b>ResumeScript</b> optional, and relaxed the
  restrictions on when <b>PauseScript</b> can be used, so it can now be used
  from macros and command files read with the <b>Source</b> action.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.4alpha1, 28. April 2015</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Allow the DFT buffer size to be changed in
  the c3270/wc3270 file transfer dialog.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Allow file transfers to be interrupted
  with Ctrl-C.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed an issue where the terminal type would not be
  reported to the host as IBM-DYNAMIC if the screen was
  put into oversize mode via a menu selection (it was correct if oversize came
  from a resource). Also
  made sure that the 'About-&gt;Configuration' display of the terminal type is
  always correct.</li>
 <li>[all] Added resources to define the default values for each of the
  IND$FILE file transfer parameters. The resources have the same names as the
  <b>Transfer</b> action keywords, with <b>ft</b> prepended. E.g., the
  <b>Mode</b> default is controlled by the <b>ftMode</b> resource. For
  consistency, deprecated <b>dftBufferSize</b> and <b>ftCodePage</b> in favor
  of <b>ftBufferSize</b> and <b>ftWindowsCodePage</b> (the old resources are
  still available).</li>
 <li>[all] Added missing functionality to specify the size for <b>avblock</b>
  TSO file allocations in IND$FILE file transfers.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Added an <b>aplCircledAlpha</b> resource to allow x3270
  to properly display APL underscored uppercase letters
  with the APL385 font,
  by translating them to the (nonstandard) Unicode circled-alphabetic range
  U+24B6 to U+25CF.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>, <i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Overhauled visible control
  characters so that field attributes are completely decoded. Field attributes
  are now in underlined yellow in x3270. Added visible control character
  support to c3270 (also underlined yellow) and wc3270 (reverse-video yellow),
  with a menu option.
 </li>
 <li>[all] Overhauled the build structure. Now there are libraries for common
  functions.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Mapped Alt-left-click onto a lightpen select operation.
  Added a <b>lightPenPrimary</b> resource to switch this, so that an unmodified
  left-click is a lightpen select and Alt-left-click is a cursor move or
  copy/paste highlight.</li>
 <li>[all] Added a <b>B:</b> prefix option to hostnames to disable the
  automatic keyboard unlock when a BIND-IMAGE is
  received.</li>
 <li>[all] Added an <b>-nvt</b> option and an <b>nvtMode</b> resource to
  force NVT mode as soon as a session is connected. This
  overrides the usual
  behavior of locking the keyboard and waiting for the host to send
  NVT-mode
  data or negotiate 3270 mode before unlocking. This option also changes the
  default terminal type to <b>xterm</b>.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Added a mapping from the Escape key to the <b>Escape()</b>
  action (breaking to the c3270&gt; prompt).</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Added a <b>maxRecent</b> resource to control the maximum
  size of the recent host list in the Connect menu.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added right-click and Enter to Copy, and right-click to
  Paste, and Enter to Copy, like Quick Edit mode.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added a <b>nodialog</b> option to <b>PrintText</b> to
  suppress with Windows print dialog.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added font auto-sizing to GDI screen
  printing.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added <i>Paste with Left Margin</i> menu.</li>
 <li>[all] Allow the <b>-scriptport</b> option to specify an address to listen
  on.</li>
 <li>[all] Added webserver support. The <b>-httpd</b> option starts a webserver
  listening on the specified port. The webserver supports a REST
  API and some basic HTML objects.</li>
 <li>[all] Removed configurability of tracing, NVT mode,
  TN3270E support, scripting, menus file transfer, the x3270 pop-up keypad and
  printer sessions (they're always enabled now).</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Added an <b>overlayPaste</b> toggle.
  When set, pasting over a protected field will simply increment the cursor
  position instead of locking the keyboard. This allows forms to be copied and
  pasted with the protected fields included. Setting this toggle also
  implicitly sets the <b>marginedPaste</b> toggle.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Changed the selection logic so that a rectangular
  selection (the default for 3270 mode) never ends with a newline character.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.15ga8, 24. December 2014</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>[<i>x3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Improved paste behavior. Patch courtesy of
   Máximo Castañeda.</li>
  <li>[all] Added <b>append</b> and <b>replace</b> keywords to the
   <b>PrintText</b> action to control how existing files are handled.</li>
  <li>[all] Made <b>Wait(Output)</b> work in NVT mode.</li>
  <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed security holes in the Print Window Bitmap menu
   item and the PrintWindow action.</li>
  <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Fixed multiple GDI printing problems: captions
   mis-centered, page overflow with multiple screens per page, "save screens
   to printer" not working at all.</li>
 </ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.15ga7, 14. December 2014</h2>

   dialog.</li>
  <li>[all] Fixed a crash in the <b>Query</b> action.</li>
 </ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.15ga6, 28. November 2014</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>[<i>wc3270</i>, <i>ws3270</i>] Fixed a bug with the <b>Transfer</b>
   action ignoring the BufferSize parameter.</li>

 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>] Added an <b>-mpp</b> option to set a non-default Maximum
  Presentation Position (the maximum line length for unformatted Write
  commands).</li>
 <li>[all] Corrected the BINARY and NOCRLF options passed to the CICS version
  of IND$FILE.</li>
 <li>[all] Added a <b>--disable-ipv6</b> option to the ./configure script to
  allow IPv6 support to be explicitly disabled.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.15beta2, 12. August 2014</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>all</i>] Changed the IND$FILE command to all-uppercase, to make
  certain hosts happier (found by Máximo Castañeda).</li>

  Castañeda).</li>
 <li>[all] Fixed some zOS/USS build issues (found by Kevin Morris).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.15alpha1, 17. July 2014</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Added a <b>newEnviron</b> resource. If set to <b>true</b> (the
  default), the emulator will respond to the TELNET NEW-ENVIRON option. If set
  to <b>false</b>, it will not.</b>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Fixed a problem where editing an all-users session would
  result in copying the session to the current user's AppData directory, and
  re-creating the shortcut would point it to the wrong entry.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added Session Wizard options to copy a session, rename a
  session, and create a shortcut for a session.</li>
 <li>[all] Fixed several issues with TN3270E options negotiation (thank you to
  Máximo Castañeda for pointing these out).</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Changed the default directory for trace files from the
  wc3270 AppData directory to the current user's desktop. Also fixed a number
  of documentation issues in this area.</li>
 <li>[all] Added a <b>tls</b> resource. If set to <b>false</b>, TLS
  negotiations from the host will be rejected.</b>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added menu options to start up HTML help and the Session
  Wizard.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] If there is room, added a line (a row of underscored
  blanks) between the 3270 display and the OIA.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Changed the menu bar to reverse video.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added a <b>Cut</b> action, mapped to Ctrl-x. It is the
  same as <b>Copy</b>, but it also erases the copied text (in modifiable
  fields) when it finishes.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>, <i>ws3270</i>] Added support for a separate Windows
  code page for IND$FILE ASCII file translations, via the <b>ftCodePage</b>
  resource and the <b>WindowsCodePage=</b> parameter to the <b>Transfer</b>
  action.</li>
 <li>[all] Produce a better error message when the host disconnects because the
  emulator does not support SSL.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added a Session Wizard option to turn on tracing at
  start-up.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Extended the Session Wizard to present a menu of existing

  </li>
 <li>[all] List out the toggle names when a <b>-set</b> or <b>-clear</b>
  doesn't find a match.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added support for GDI (direct) printers to the
  <b>PrintText()</b> and <b>ScreenTrace()</b> actions using the new <b>gdi</b>
  keyword option. Added resources to control GDI printing:
  <b>printTextOrientation</b>, <b>printTextHorizontalMargin</b> and
  <b>printTextVerticalMargin</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14ga11, 3. May 2014</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Changed the <b>-xtable</b> option so that
  the translations are considered transparent data (they are not considered
  when checking for line wrap or when skipping ASA carriage control
  characters).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14ga10, 27. April 2014</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Restored the ability to use the special 3270 fonts with
  code page 1047.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Backed out the previous change to ignore
  NULLs (they really are supposed to be considered blanks in unformatted Write
  commands). Replaced it with a new <b>-skipcc</b> option to ignore ASA
  carriage control characters at the beginning of each line; it only applies
  to unformatted Write commands.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14ga9, 13. April 2014</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Fixed a problem with misinterpreting
  NULL (X'00') characters in unformatted mode as spaces, when they should be
  ignored. This caused printer output to be shifted and sometimes wrapped.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Corrected the <b>Copy()</b> action so the space after a
  word selected with a double mouse click is not copied to the clipboard.</li>
 <li>[all 3270] Fixed a crash when disabling tracing after opening the trace
  file fails.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14beta8, 31. March 2014</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all 3270] Changed the keyboard to unlock when a BIND-IMAGE is received.
  This matches the behavior of PCOMM and is consistent with some comments found
  on IBM webpages. The net result is that the keyboard will be unlocked (and
  scripts may be allowed to proceed) earlier than with previous versions of the
  emulators. This is good for talking to hosts that don't send an initial Write
  command (as can happen with CICS); previously this Write was the only trigger
  for unlocking the keyboard at connect or BIND time. But it is bad if a script
  implicitly depended on the old behavior. Scripts confused by this change may
  need to add a <b>Wait(InputField)</b> to cover these cases.</li>
 <li>[all 3270] Got rid of the <b>E</b> status for keyboard lock in the
  scripting prompt. The status is now <b>L</b> (locked) or <b>U</b>
  (unlocked).</li>
 <li>[all 3270] Added decoding of UNBIND reasons to traces.</li>
 <li>[all 3270] Increased the number of situations where keyboard input can
  result in typeahead instead of drops.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14ga7, 8. March 2014</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i></i>] Corrected a problem where the
  <b>trace on</b> command at the <b>c3270></b> prompt resulted in tracing to
  a file named <b>on</b>.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i></i>] Reversed the order of keymaps.
  User-specified keymaps appear first, with later-specified ones before
  earlier-specified ones, so the override relationships are more obvious.
  On Windows, this also resolves the rules for ambiguous keymaps -- the first
  match wins, given the new ordering rules.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i></i>] Fixed a problem with printable virtual key events
  being interpreted incorrectly, even though they were traced correctly, for
  example, Ctrl-Shift-3.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i></i>] Fixed a problem with the <b>RightCtrl</b> modifier
  in a keymap being interpreted as <b>Ctrl</b>.
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>Fixed some man pages that accidentally ended up as html.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14ga6, 23. January 2014</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Fixed a problem with displaying text in NVT mode when the host
  does no TELNET negotiation.</li>
 <li>[all] Deprecated the <b>dsTrace</b> and <b>eventTrace</b> resources (and
  associated toggles and x3270 menu options) and replaced them with a new
  single <b>trace</b> resource and toggle. The old resources and toggles are
  still available, but are effectively aliases for the new single setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14alpha5, 30. December 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Added screen scrolling (saving previous
  screen contents, to be displayed interactively), controlled by the new
  <b>Scroll</b> action. <b>Scroll</b>(Backward) (mapped onto PageUp) goes back
  one screen; <b>Scroll</b>(Forward) (mapped onto PageDown) goes ahead one
  screen. The <b>Reset</b> action cancels scrolling. The <b>-sl</b>
  command-line option or <b>scrollLines</b> resource changes the number of
  lines saved for scrolling from the default of 4096.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Turned the scrollbar on by default. Mapped the PageUp and
  PageDown keys to the (new) <b>Scroll</b> action, to scroll up or down one
  screen, respectively. Modified the <b>Reset</b> action to cancel any
  screen scrolling.</li>
 <li>[all Windows] Got everything to build under MSVC again, using either the
  command line or MS Visual Studio. A Visual Studio solution file is now
  included in the source tarball. Windows targets also cross-compile again with
  the latest Cygwin MinGW.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14alpha4, 21. December 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Added a <b>printTextScreensPerPage</b> resource to control how many
  screens of text are displayed per page when tracing screens to the
  printer.</li>
 <li>[all] Corrected screen tracing to the printer so it observes the
 <b>printer.name</b> and <b>printer.command</b> resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14alpha3, 16. December 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>all</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Fixed problem with message display during
  file transfers initiated by scripts.</li>
 <li>[all] Fixed a problem reading files with the <b>Source</b> action, when
  the file does not end with a CR or NL.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14alpha2, 4. November 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Added support for CICS IND$FILE file transfers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.14alpha1, 30. October 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Allow file transfers to start when the screen is unformatted.</li>
 <li>[all] Fixed a problem with the initial data stream trace snapshot when the
  screen is unformatted.</li>
 <li>A wrapper function was put around the Windows <i>snprintf</i> function,
  to ensure that it always NUL-terminates strings. The lack of such a wrapper
  could lead to string overflows in some situations.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added the ability to install wc3270 for all users or just
  for the current
  user (the old behavior was just the current user). Also extended the
  installer to allow selective installation of various pieces. The Session
  Wizard can now create and edit session files and desktop shortcuts for either
  all users or the current user, and keymaps can be located in either the
  all-users or current user's AppData directory. Trace files are always left
  in the current user's AppData directory.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] wc3270 Session files are now editable from the Windows
  context menu (right-clicking from explorer).</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Windows 98 is no longer supported by the wc3270 installer.
  This is
  because the installer tool used by wc3270 (Inno Setup) no longer supports
  Windows 98, not because of any inherent limitation in wc3270. The no-setup
  .ZIP file can still be used to install wc3270 on Windows 98 by hand. A
  simple Windows 98-specific installer may be added at some point in the
  future.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added native select/copy to wc3270. Just highlight with
  the mouse and press Ctrl-C. The <b>Clear</b> action is still available via
  Alt-C.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.13ga7, 11. September 2013</h2>

 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Fixed a hang when the wc3270 window was closed on XP.</li>
 <li>[all] Fixed connect() failures on MacOS.</li>
</ul>

 <li>[<i>wpr3287</i>] Added the <b>-tracedir</b> option, just like pr3287.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Added tracing of the <b>-xtable</b>
  translation table.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Added tracing of the data stream sent to
  the printer.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Use the same unique trace file name
  convention as the other emulators.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Added a <b>-crthru</b> option to pass
  CR orders through to the printer in unformatted 3270 mode, instead of
  interpreting them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.13beta5, 4. September 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added logic to the Session Wizard to automatically correct
  old-format UNC printer names, and also fixed some minor bugs in it.</li>
 <li>[all] Corrected the CGCSGID for code page 1145 (spanish-euro).</li>
 <li>[all] Second try at getting pr3287/wpr3287 shut down and re-launched
  correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.13beta4, 23. August 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Corrected the start/stop of pr3287/wpr3287 printer sessions, so that
  a new one is not started until the previous one has completely exited.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.13beta3, 6. August 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Made sure trace files get flushed for each
  entry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.13alpha2, 30. July 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all] Fixed a crash when connecting to certain hosts using an SSL tunnel.
  </li>
 <li>[all except <i>x3270</i>] Fixed a parsing problem for session files and
  <b>-xrm</b> options that resulted in doubled backslash characters.</li>
 <li>[all] Fixed a crash in the <b>Wait(<i>n</i>,seconds)</b> action.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Made sure that the wpr3287 process is stopped when the
  wc3270 window is closed.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Fixed new issues created by the previous Windows 8 process
  creation fix.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.13alpha1, 11. July 2013</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Fixed some issues with starting Wordpad and wpr3287 on
  Windows 8.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Combined the various text screen save/print options into
  a single menu option, which brings up a dialog box that allows snapshots,
  continuous saving, save to text, HTML or RichText or directly to the
  printer.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Added the ability to save a stream of
  screens to the printer via a menu option or the new <b>Printer</b> option to
  the <b>ScreenTrace</b> action.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Added a <b>-secure</b> to simplify invoking secure mode.
  </li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Allow <b>-noprompt</b> mode without a host
  specified on the command line.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Added custom translation tables via the
  <b>-xtable</b> option.</li>
 <li>[<i>pr3287</i>, <i>wpr3287</i>] Made <b>-emflush</b> the default.
  Added a <b>-noemflush</b> to specify the old behavior.</li>
 <li>[all] Corrected a problem with interpreting the <b>SuppressMap</b>
  resource. (Courtesy of Marcin Cie&#347;lak.)</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Corrected the working directory for auto-shortcut mode.
  </li>
 <li>[all] Added the <b>-accepthostname</b> command-line option and
  <b>acceptHostname</b> resource to allow accepting specific names and IP
  addresses in host certificates, or any name.</li>
 <li>[all] Turned off variable substitution for all actions under certain
  circumstances, such as inside macros. It mostly just caused confusion.</li>
 <li>[all] Added two pseudo-variables for filename substitutions: ${TIMESTAMP}
  becomes a microsecond-resolution timestamp and ${UNIQUE} guarantees that the
  filename is unique. Changed the default trace file names to use ${UNIQUE}.
  </li>
 <li>[all] Added a number of keywords to the <b>Query</b> action.</li>
 <li>[all] Made the <b>Open</b> (<b>Connect</b>) and <b>Close</b>
  (<b>Disconnect</b>) aliases available everywhere.</li>
 <li>[<i>s3270</i>, <i>ws3270</i>] Enabled the idle command (the
  <b>idleCommand</b>, <b>idleCommandEnabled</b> and <b>idleTimeout</b>
  resources).</li>
 <li>[all] Added support for code page 803 (hebrew-old).</li>
 <li>[<i>s3270</i>, <i>ws3270</i>] Added a <b>-utf8</b> command-line option and
  a <b>utf8</b> resource to force local I/O to be encoded as UTF-8.</li>
 <li>[all] Added a <b>-loginmacro</b> command-line option, and made the
  existing <b>loginMacro</b> resource work on x3270.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Made screen printing via <b>PrintText</b> (Alt-P)
  asynchronous, so wc3270 can continue processing keyboard events and host
  output while the screen print is being prepared.</li>
 <li>[<i>s3270</i>, <i>ws3270</i>, <i>tcl3270</i>] Made 3279 (color) mode the
  default.</li>
 <li>[all] Added output to scripts to the event trace file.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i/>, <i>ws3270</i>] Now there is a single wc3270 .exe file and
  a single ws3270 .exe file; they each find the OpenSSL DLLs automatically if
  they are installed.
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.12ga13, 2. May 2013</h2>
<ul>

<ul>
 <li>[All] Added logic to verify the name in the host certificate.</li>
 <li>[All] Pass all SSL-related parameters to the pr3287 session.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] On the <b>Connect</b> menu, made the recent host list a
  pull-right sub-menu, if there is an ibm_hosts file in use.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] The <b>-trace</b> option now implies event tracing as well.
  </li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Spaces are now allowed in the file transfer dialog local
  file name.</li>
 <li>[all] Corrected issues when invalid Unicode characters are encountered
  during a file transfer.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>, <i>wc3270</i>] Corrected a crash when tracing without a
  file, when the monitor window was closed.</li>
 <li>[<i>ws3270</i>] Corrected the behavior of stdin processing, so ws3270 is
  not blocked trying to read stdin most of the time. Also fixed an issue where
  the scripting prompt would start with <b>E</b> when the keyboard was in
  inhibit mode.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Removed a duplicated rule in Msc/Makefile.</li>
 <li>[all] Changed the CGCSGID for cp930 (Japanese) 0x080b012c (2059, 300) to
  0x0172012c (370, 300).</li>

 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Improved behavior when SSL negotiation fails.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270, c3270, wc3270</i>] Changed the 'secure' icon to green when
  SSL/TLS is active and the host is verified, and yellow when SSL/TLS is
  active but the host certificate is unverified.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Added a <b>defaultFgBg</b> resource and <b>-defaultfgbg</b>
  option to use the terminal's default foreground and background colors in
  place of the curses colors <b>white</b> and <b>black</b> respectively -- if
  the ncurses library, terminal and termcap/terminfo entry support default

 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Added a key sequence for screen printing (<b>Ctrl-a</b>,
 <b>p</b>).</li>
</ul>

  <b>%O%</b> will be substituted with the value of the new
  <b>printer.options</b> resource.  This allows extra options such as

  connections.</li>
 <li>[all] Corrected the reported CGCSGID for code page 1147
  (french-euro).</li>
 <li>[all except <i>x3270</i>] Disabled the Query Reply report for background
  color support, which confused some older versions of GDDM.  This report can
  be explicitly enabled by setting the <b>qrBgColor</b> resource to
  <b>true</b>.</li>

  resources.</li>
 <li>Changed the default 'blue' color for created shortcuts
  to a somewhat lighter shade, to make it more readable.</li>
  <li>Changed the <i>Session Wizard</i> to specify the code page
  and proper font when creating shortcuts for DBCS sessions.  This should
  allow DBCS to work on Windows 2000 and Vista.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.8, 11 October 2008</h2>
Version 3.3.8 includes a significant internal change, using Unicode for all
translations between the host and the local workstation.
This change should be
transparent, but users who depended on certain behaviors of the old
implementation may see unexpected differences.
<h3>Common Changes</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Many more EBCDIC characters, such as Graphics Escape line-drawing and APL
  characters, are now properly displayed (even without special 3270 fonts),
  traced, cut/pasted with other applications, and returned by scripting actions
  like <b>Ascii</b>.
 <li>With two exceptions, the locale's encoding is now observed consistently
  when reading keymaps, generating trace files, etc.
  The exceptions are:
  <ul>
   <li><b>tcl3270</b> always uses UTF-8, per the internal Tcl convention.</li>
   <li>Because Cygwin doesn't really support locales, the Windows ANSI code
    page is used as the local encoding instead.</li>
   <li>Stateful encodings such as ISO 2022 are untested and very likely do
    not work.</li>
  </ul>
 <li>The ICU library is no longer used, and ICU <b>.cnv</b> files are no longer
  included with the code.</li>
 <li>Translation to/from the local encoding requires one of two facilities:
  Either <b>libc</b> must support <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> (<b>wchar_t</b>s
  are defined to be Unicode values, as on Linux and Windows), or there must be
  an <b>iconv</b> library that can translate between UTF-8 and all local
  encodings.</li>
 <li>DBCS support is enabled by default, except on Windows.
  It can be explicitly
  disabled in the <b>configure</b> script to reduce the size of the
  executable (removing several large translation tables).</li>
 <li>The <b>-v</b>/<b>--verbose</b> option has been added to display build and
  copyright information.</li>
 <li>The Thai host code page has changed from 838 to 1160.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes Common to the 3270 Terminal Emulators</h3>
<ul>
 <li>The <b>Key</b> action now accepts Unicode arguments in the form
  <b>U+<i>nnnn</i></b>, removing possible ambiguity from translating from the
 <li>Added a <b>Source</b> action to read script commands from a file.</li>
 <li> Added a 10 second timeout to the start of the <b>Transfer</b> action.</li>
 <li>Added an <b>unlockDelayMs</b> resource to change the number of
  milliseconds of delay before actually unlocking the keyboard after the
  host requests it. The default is 350; use 0 to disable the delay
  altogether.</li>
 <li>IND$FILE file transfer now transfers DBCS text files properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes Common to 3287 Printer Emulators</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added direct support for all <b>x3270</b> host character sets via the
  <b>-charset</b> option.
 <li>Added <b>-trnpre</b> and <b>-trnpost</b> options to specify files
  containing transparent data to send to the printer before and after
  each print job, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product-Specific Changes</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Commands entered into the <b>Print Screen Text</b> dialog
  are now saved by the <b>Save Changed Options in File</b> option.
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed some bad interactions between the pop-up keypad and
  the GNOME window manager.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] The Euro fonts have been folded into the standard
  fonts.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] The font menu is now arranged hierarchically by
  foundry and family.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Added an <b>underscore</b> toggle to allow underlined
  fields to be displayed even on consoles with no native underlining
  support, by substituting underscore '_' characters for blanks and nulls
  in underlined fields.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Overhauled <b>Meta</b> and <b>Alt</b> key support.
  Removed support for the archaic <b>Meta</b> modifier in keymaps (it was an
  alias for setting bit 0x80 in each key).  Replaced it with an <b>Alt</b>
  modifier, which matches the <b>ESC</b> sequence sent for the <b>Alt</b> key
  by many terminals, and which can be combined with full 8-bit input
  characters.<li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Changed the interpretation of keymaps so that keys and
  symbols are matched in Unicode.  That is, keymap text is converted from the
  current locale's encoding to Unicode before matching, and input character
  codes are converted to Unicode before matching.  This eliminates the
  difficulty in creating keymaps and interpreting traces in non-Latin-1
  locales -- needing to translate from the accidental interpretation of
  8-bit values as Latin-1 when they are not -- but with the side-effect
  of rendering some carefully-crafted existing keymaps invalid.  Keymaps
  can also be written using Unicode <b>U+<i>nnnn</i></b> notation.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Changed the <b>metaEscape</b> resource so that <b>auto</b>
  means <b>on</b>, instead of using the terminfo <b>km</b> resource.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Added an <b>acs</b> resource to control the use of curses
  ACS codes.
  If <b>c3270.acs</b> is set to <b>true</b> (the default), <b>c3270</b>
  will use curses ACS codes for line-drawing characters.  If set to
  <b>false</b>, it will display line-drawing characters with Unicode.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added an <b>underscore</b> toggle to control how
  underlined and blinking fields are displayed.  If it is set (the default),
  underlined fields are displayed by substituting underscore (_)
  characters for blanks and nulls, and blinking fields actually blink.
  If it is clear, underlined and blinking fields are displayed with
  highlighted backgrounds, which is compatible with previous versions of
  <b>wc3270</b>.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Left-clicking with the mouse will now move the cursor
  to that location.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] The <b>PrintText</b> action now works, and is mapped by
  default to the sequence <b>Alt &lt;Key&gt;p</b>.
  The <b>printer.name</b> resource defines the default printer to use.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] The <b>PrintText</b> action can now be used to produce
  a RichText snapshot of the screen contents, via the <b>rtf</b> keyword.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] The program longer attempts to set the console code page,
  which was error-prone and unnecessary.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] The <i>idle command</i> feature now works, controlled
  by the <b>idleCommand</b>, <b>idleCommandEnabled</b> and <b>idleTimeout</b>
  resources.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] The program no longer attempts to set the console code
  page, which could lead to hangs on Vista.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] The installation now creates a program group item to
  explore the <b>wc3270</b> Application Data directory.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Corrected a problem with console color overrides, which
  prevented reverse-video mode (white background) from working properly.
  For now, the recommended method for enabling reverse video mode is to add
  these lines to your session file:
  <pre>
      wc3270.consoleColorForHostColor0: 15
      wc3270.consoleColorForHostColor7: 0</pre></li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] <b>wc3270</b> now builds with the Microsoft tools.
  The file <tt>Msc/Makefile</tt> is a makefile for <b>nmake</b>.</li>
 <li>[<i>tcl3270</i>] Added a <b>commandTimeout</b> resource to force any
  <b>Tcl3270</b> command to time out after the specified number of seconds.
  (Thanks to Mark Young.)</li>
 <li>[<i>tcl3270</i>] Fixed a per-command memory leak. (Thanks to Mark
  Young.)</li>
 <li>[<i>wpr3287</i>] Added a <b>-printercp</b> option to specify a particular
  code page for printer output.</li>
 <li>[<i>wpr3287</i>] <b>wpr3287</b> now builds with the Microsoft tools.
  The file <tt>Msc/Makefile</tt> is a makefile for <b>nmake</b>.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added limited support for Windows 98.  wc3270 will install and run on
       Windows 98, but internationalization support is limited -- the only
       supported host code page is 37, and the only supported Windows code
       page is 437.  This is expected to improve in the future.</li>
      <li>Added a <b>wc3270.highlightUnderline</b> resource to control
       highlighting of underlined and blinking text.  (Set to <b>false</b> to
       disable background highlighting.)</li>
      <li>Moved session files, keymaps and trace files to the Application
       Data directory. (<b>wc3270</b> will still look in its installation
       directory for session files and keymaps, after first searching the
       Application Data directory.)
       This makes <b>wc3270</b> a better Windows citizen in general, and a
       better Vista citizen in particular.</li>
      <li>Added support for changing the color mappings.  The console color
       for a given host color can be specified with the resource
       <b>wc3270.consoleColorForHostColor<i>n</i></b>, where <i>n</i> is a
       host color number (0 through 15), and the value of the resource is a
       console color number (0 through 15).
       <br>In addition, the
       field-attribute-based colors used when the host does not specify a
       particular color can be changed via the following resources:
       <pre>
wc3270.hostColorForDefault
wc3270.hostColorForIntensified
wc3270.hostColorForProtected
wc3270.hostColorForProtectedIntensified
       </pre>
       The value for each of these is a host color number; the actual color
       displayed is defined by the corresponding
       <b>wc3270.consoleColorForHostColor<i>n</i></b>
       resource.</li>
      <li>Added a new <b>cp1153</b> character set.
       It implements host code page 1153 and uses Windows code page 1250,
       used primarily in Central Europe.</li>
      <li>Added display of the Windows code page to the character set
       screen in the New Session Wizard.</li>
      <li>Added display of the host and Windows code pages to the <b>show
       status</b> command.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added UTF-8 support.  If the current locale specifies UTF-8 encoding,
      then all text output (trace data, screen snapshots, the <b>Ascii</b>

      etc.) must be UTF-8 encoded.
      In addition, the NVT-mode xterm/VT100 emulator will expect UTF-8.
      <p><b>NOTE</b>: If you were were previously running <b>s3270</b> in a
      UTF-8 locale, <i>this is an incompatible change</i>.

<h2>Changes in x3270 3.3.6, 23. June 2007</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed the <b>highlighted</b> attribute for individual regions of the
      screen (versus the <b>highlighted</b> field attribute); it had been
      accidentally disabled.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for IBM Code Page 1047 (<b>-charset cp1047</b>).</li>
      <li>Added proxy support via the <b>-proxy</b> option or the <b>proxy</b>
      resource.</li>
      <li>Modified <i>Blank Fill</i> mode to treat trailing underscore
      characters ('<b>_</b>') like blanks when checking for input
      overflow.</li>
      <li><i>Pseudo-Color</i> mode is no more.
      This was the mode that x3270 used when a 3278 model was specified, or
      if the <b>m3279</b> resource were set to <b>False</b>.
      Pseudo-Color assigned colors to regions of the screen based on
      intensity and light-pen selectability, and did not support 3279 colors.
      Now turning off color or selecting a 3278 results in something that
      looks like a 3278 (i.e., it's green).
      To resurrect Pseudo-Color mode, set the following resources:
      <preformat>
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;x3270.inputColor: orange<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;x3270.boldColor: cyan

      <li>Like <b>x3270</b> and <b>wc3270</b>, <b>-model 3278</b> now
      specifies a green-screen 3278 (if the terminal supports color), and

       x3270 and c3270.</li>
      <li>Corrected the definition of the <b>hebrew</b> (code page 424)
       character set, removing undefined characters.</li>
      <li>Corrected the display character set for the <b>brazilian</b> (code
       page 275) character set.</li>
      <li>Corrected the character set definition logic so that undefined
       ASCII codes are truly undefined in NVT mode.</li>
      <li>Corrected the <b>ibm_hosts</b> file (the <b>hostsFile</b> resource
       or the <b>-hostsfile</b> option).
       Variable and tilde substitution are now performed on the value, and if
       a non-default value is specified and the file does not exist, an error
       pop-up is generated.</li>
      <li>Added a pause to make sure that c3270 start-up error messages will
       be seen.</li>
      <li>Got the c3270 default field colors right, and made all-bold mode
       actually make all the fields bold.</li>
      <li>Fixed the default primary/alternate screen size (it was alternate,
       it's supposed to be primary).</li>
      <li>Fixed c3270 color support with ncurses and 80/132 screen-size
       switching.
       Sometimes only one of the screen sizes had color.</li>
      <li>Fixed a memory leak in pr3287 when the <b>-reconnect</b> option
       is used. (<i>Thanks to Marcelo Lemos for the fix.</i>)</li>
      <li>Fixed the output of NVT-mode ANSI line-drawing characters in the
       <b>Ascii()</b> scripting action.
       These were formerly all output as blanks; now they are output in
       the same was as x3270 3.2.</li>
      <li>Fixed the display of NVT-mode ANSI line-drawing characters when
       x3270 is using a 3270 font.</li>
      <li>Fixed the display of DBCS blanks, which sometimes displayed as
       'undefined' characters.</li>
      <li>Fixed DBCS character display with fonts whose maximum bounds are
       larger than their reported line-spacing bounds.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>make depend</b>.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>x3270_glue.expect</b>, which got confused when there was
       a whitespace-delimited double-quote in the emulator output.</li>
      <li>Fixed crashes when the entire File or Options menus were suppressed.
       </li>
      <li>Fixed a scripting hang when an UNBIND command arrived while an AID
       was pending.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem with the incomplete processing of a NULLing Program
       Tab order, which could leave formatting artifacts on the screen.</li>
      <li>Removed &lt;subchar1&gt; clauses in two of the <b>.ucm</b> files
       that prevents later versions of ICU's <b>makeconv</b> from accepting
       them, and removed DOS carriage-return characters from the CP837
       <b>.ucm</b> file.</li>
      <li>Corrected some DFT-mode file upload problems: corrected the data
       length, and corrected an empty-buffer problem when the file size was
       an even multiple of the buffer size.</li>
      <li>Corrected a DBCS conversion problem with ICU 3.0.</li>
      <li>Added variable buffer-size support to DFT file transfers.</li>
      <li>Corrected a line-drawing character bug in c3270.</li>
      <li>Fixed a buffer overflow problem in the <b>ReadBuffer</b> action.</li>
      <li>Fixed garbage characters generated for APL data by the <b>Ascii</b>
       and <b>ReadBuffer</b> actions.</li>
      <li>Allow 0 timeouts in <b>Wait</b> actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added command-line options to the pr3287 trace file.</li>
      <li>Added support for <i>dead</i> keys (acute, grave, circumflex, tilde,
       diaeresis) to the x3270 default keymap, and improved the Latin-1 compose
       map. (<i>Thanks to Marcelo Lemos for the change.</i>)</li>
      <li>Added new actions for improved mouse interactions, and made them the
       default.  Button 1 now moves the cursor, without the Shift key.</li>
      <li>Added support for DBCS in pr3287, but only when started from an
       x3270 or c3270 session.</li>
      <li>Added Don Russell's RPQNAMES support.</li>
      <li>Removed Minolta-copyrighted 5250 code, because of licensing
       problems.</li>
      <li>Added an <b>aidWait</b> toggle to allow AID script actions
       (<b>Clear</b>, <b>Enter</b>, <b>PA</b> and <b>PF</b>) to complete
       immediately without waiting for the host to unlock the keyboard, and a
       <b>Wait(Unlock)</b> action action to block a script until the keyboard
       is unlocked, regardless of the state of the new toggle.</li>
      <li>Removed the old scripting hack that delayed actually unlocking the
       keyboard for 50ms after the host indicates that it should be unlocked.
       Added an <b>unlockDelay</b> resource, which can be set to <b>true</b> to
       turn the delay hack back on.</li>
      <li>Added a <b>dftBufferSize</b> resource to set the default DFT
       buffer size.</li>
      <li>Added an x3270  <b>Save Screen Text</b> menu option to save the
       screen image in a file, optionally in HTML.</li>
      <li>Added options to the PrintText action to save to a file, to save HTML,
       and to return the text as script data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in x3270, c3270, s3270 and tcl3270 3.3.2, 1. December 2003</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected an x3270 screen-redraw crash when using <b>fixedSize</b>
       and <b>xim</b>.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem in <b>x3270_glue.expect</b>, which caused
       Tcl syntax errors if a string began with a dash. <i>Thanks to David
       Taylor for the fix.</i></li>  
      <li>Fixed a problem with x3270 DBCS input when using a single DBCS/SBCS
       character set.</li>
      <li>Made DBCS encoding recognition automatic wherever possible, leaving
       the <b>-km</b> option for cases when x3270 can't figure it out from the
       locale.</li>
      <li>Made c3270's <b>configure</b> more robust when it can't find one or
       the other of <b>libncurses</b> or <b>ncurses.h</b>.</li>
      <li>Got automatic pr3287 start-up (<b>-printerlu</b>) working again in
       c3270.</li>
      <li>Fixed an s3270 crash which made s3270 3.3.1alpha10 pretty much
       useless.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
     <li>Added support for Cyrillic keysyms to the x3270 <b>Default()</b>
      action.</li>
     <li>Added an 'unlocked' icon for unencrypted connections, if x3270 is
      built with SSL/TLS support.</li>
     <li>Error messages are now written to the trace file.</li>
     <li>The response to the TELNET TIMING MARK option has been changed to
      make it compatible with the majority of TELNET clients.
      The response to DO TIMING MARK is now WONT TIMING MARK.
      To restore the previous behavior (responding with WILL TIMING MARK,
      originally derived from the BSD TELNET client), set the resource
      <b>x3270.bsdTm</b> to <b>true</b>.
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

     <li>Added support for <b>suppress</b> resources for each menu item.
      If set to <b>True</b>, that menu item will not appear.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>suppressActions</b> resource, a list of the names of
      actions to disable.  This is primarily for controlled environments where
      the user does not have access to the <b>x3270</b> command line, but can
      edit keymap definitions.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>Setverbose</b> function to <tt>x3270_glue.expect</tt>

      be.</li>
     <li>Added a new x3270 keypad position (<b>x3270.keypad</b>):
      <b>insideRight</b>.  This positions the keypad on top of the upper

  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>x3270 user-specified lists (character sets, hosts, fonts,
       color schemes) can now be organized into sub-lists.
       The name <b>Bob>Fred>Tony</b> specifies that there is a sub-list called
       <b>Bob</b>, which contains a sub-list <b>Fred</b>, which contains the
