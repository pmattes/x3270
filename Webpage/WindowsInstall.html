	<h2>Notes for Version Upgrades</h2>
	<h3>AppData File Migration</h3>
	Release 3.5beta5 stopped the use of the wc3270 AppData folders. When
	upgrading from an earlier release to 3.5beta5 or later, session
	and keymap files in an wc3270 AppData folder must be copied to a
	Documents folder (a user's My Documents or the Public Documents
	folder) and desktop session shortcuts must be replaced.
	A Migration Wizard will be run automatically by the installer to handle
	this, allowing the user to control which files are copied. (Note that
	when using unattended installation, the Migration Wizard will copy all
	of the files.)
	<p>
	The Migration wizard will copy only files for the user running the
	installer and shared files. After the upgrade, other users will be
	offered an option in the Session Wizard to migrate their own files.
	<p>
	File migration will only happen once per user and for shared files.
	The files will be preserved in the AppData folders, but will be
	ignored.
	<h3>Upgrading from 32-bit to 64-bit</h3>
	Release 3.5alpha4 was the first with 64-bit Windows support. When
	upgrading on 64-bit Windows from an earlier release to 3.5alpha4 or
	later, the old 32-bit version must be uninstalled before 64-bit
	installation can proceed. This will be done automatically by the 64-bit
	installer (with the user's permission; if installing unattended, it
	will always be performed).
