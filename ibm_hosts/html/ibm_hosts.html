<a NAME="Name"></a><h2>Name</h2>
ibm_hosts - host database for x3270 and c3270
<a NAME="Synopsis"></a><h2>Synopsis</h2>
/usr/lib/X11/x3270/ibm_hosts
<a NAME="Description"></a><h2>Description</h2>
The <b>ibm_hosts</b>
file contains information regarding IBM hosts on the network.
An <i>IBM host</i> is a host which can communicate with a 3270 terminal
emulator such as <b>x3270</b> or <b>c3270</b>.
Each line defines a name in the following format
(optional fields are shown in brackets):
<p>
<i>name</i>	<i>type</i> [<i>opt</i>:]...[<i>luname</i>@]<i>hostname</i>[:<i>port</i>] [<i>actions</i>]
<p>
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or TAB characters.
A line beginning with # is taken as a comment (note that # anywhere
else on a line does <i>not</i> indicate a comment).
<p>
The <i>name</i> field is a mnemonic used to identify the host.
<p>
The <i>type</i> field is a keyword that indicates the type of entry.
The value <b>primary</b> means that the <i>name</i>
will be included in host-selection menus that may be displayed by a
3270 emulator.
The value <b>alias</b> means that the <i>name</i>
will not be included in menus, but will still be accepted as valid input
when a host name is required.
<p>
The <i>hostname</i>
field is the Internet hostname or dot-notation Internet address of the host.
<p>
The <i>hostname</i>
can include `s:' or `p:' prefixes, e.g., <b>s:finicky</b>
(see the <a HREF="x3270-man.html"><i>x3270</i>(1)</a> or
<a HREF="c3270-man.html"><i>c3270</i>(1)</a> man page sfor details).
It can also include an LU name, separated by an `@' character, e.g.,
<b>oddlu@bluehost</b>.
Finally, it can include a non-default <i>port</i> number, appended to the
<i>hostname</i> with a colon `:' character, e.g.,
<b>bluehost:97</b>.
(For compatibility with earlier versions of <i>x3270</i>,
the <i>port</i> can also be separated by a slash `/' character.)
<p>
The optional <i>actions</i>
field specifies actions to be taken once the connection is made and a
data-entry field is defined.
If the text looks like an action, e.g.,
<b>PF(1)</b>,
it is unmodified; otherwise it is taken as the parameter to the
<b>String()</b>
action.
The
<i>actions</i>
are not intended for entering usernames and passwords; rather they provide an
automated way of specifying a front-end menu option.
<a NAME="Example"></a><h2>Example</h2>
Given the following
<b>ibm_hosts</b>
file:
<p>
<blockquote>mvs	primary	mvs-host
<br>
tso	alias	mvs-host
<br>
mvs2	primary	mvs-host:4012
<br>
vm	primary	vtam	Tab() String(3) Enter()
</blockquote>
A 3270 emulator will display four names (<b>mvs</b>, <b>mvs2</b>,
<b>afhost</b> and <b>vm</b>) on its hosts menu.
The names <b>mvs</b> and <b>tso</b> will cause connections to the host
<b>mvs-host</b>.
The name <b>mvs2</b> will also cause a connection to
<b>mvs-host</b>,
but to port 4012 rather than the emulator's default port (usually 23).
The name <b>vm</b> will cause the 3270 emulator to connect to the host
<b>vtam</b> (presumably some sort of host-selection front-end),
enter the string `3' on the second data-entry field on the screen, and
send the Enter <font size=-1>AID</font> sequence.
