<H1>wc3270 Frequently Asked Questions</H1>

If you have a problem building, installing, or running wc3270, please browse
through this file first.

<H2>General Questions</H2>

<H3>Am I allowed to use it?</H3>

    Yes.  Full copyright information is in the
    <A HREF="Lineage.html">Lineage</A> file, but the gist
    is that anyone is free to use the code, and anyone is free to sell copies
    of the code.
<P>
    You are also free to modify it and to redistribute it, provided you
    preserve the existing copyright notices.

<h3>What versions of Windows does wc3270 run on?</h3>

wc3270 has been tested on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and
Windows Vista, and has been tested on both 32- and 64-bit systems.
It also runs, with some limitations, on Windows 98.

<h3>How do I change the font?</h3>

To change any of the screen properties for wc3270 (font, font size, colors,
cursor type, etc.), you should modify the properties of a wc3270 desktop
shortcut, and then run wc3270 to see the results.  If you modify the properties
of a live wc3270 session, you may get odd and inconsistent results.

<p>
Note that if you want to run anything other than one of the basic U.S.
character sets (<b>us-english</b> or <b>bracket</b>), then it is not a good idea
to change the font, because non-English character set support requires
a full Unicode fixed-width font, and <i>Lucida Console</i> is the only one
provided with Windows.

<h3>How do I change the keyboard mappings?</h3>

Eventually, there will be a utility to create and edit custom keymaps.
In the meantime, a tutorial for the manual procedure is
<a href="Keymap.html">here</a> and the reference for keymaps is
<a href="wc3270-man.html#Keymaps">here</a>.
