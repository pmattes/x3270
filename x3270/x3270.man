.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBx3270\fP opens a telnet connection to an \s-1IBM\s+1
host in an X window.
It implements RFCs 2355 (TN3270E), 1576 (TN3270) and 1646 (LU name selection),
and supports IND$FILE file transfer.
The window created by \fBx3270\fP
can use its own font for displaying characters, so it is a fairly accurate
representation of an \s-1IBM\s+1 3278 or 3279.
It is similar to \fItn3270\fP(1) except that it is X11-based, not curses-based.
.SH "WIKI"
Primary documentation for x3270 is on the \fBx3270 Wiki\fP, https://x3270.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page.
