	<h1>x3270 Additional Build and Install Instructions</h1>

	<i>This file describes build and install information specific to
	x3270. For general build information, look
	<a href="Build.html">here</a>.</i>

	<h2>Installing Fonts</h2>
	x3270 prefers that its fonts be installed in order to run. However,
	a script is provided for testing a local copy of x3270 in the current
	directory:  
	<pre><tt>   ./dryrun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # test x3270</tt></pre>
	Before running x3270, you will also need to (once):  
	<pre><tt>   xset fp rehash</tt></pre>

	<h2> Vanilla X11R6</h2>
	x3270 is set up to build and install without modifications under
	any complete X11R6 installation.  
	<p>A "complete" installation means that besides the usual X and Xt
	libraries, the Xaw and Xmu libraries and header files are installed.
	Some vendors (HP, IBM, SCO) consider these optional software and do not
	always install them.

	<h2>IBM AIX</h2>
	The default installation of AIX may also not include the
	<i>bdftopcf</i> utility, which may need to be installed separately as
	part of the <b>X11.fnt.util</b> package.

	<h2> HP-UX</h2>
	HP's X11 distribution may not include the Xaw and Xmu libraries or
	their header files. As HP's X man page says,  
	<blockquote>A number of unsupported core MIT clients and miscellaneous
	    utilities are provided in /usr/contrib/bin. In addition, the entire
	    core MIT distribution, compiled for Hewlett-Packard platforms, can
	    be obtained from HP's users group INTERWORKS for a nominal fee. See
	    the release notes for details.</blockquote>

	<h2> Sun Solaris 2.x</h2>
	To run x3270, your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment variable
	must include <tt>/usr/openwin/lib</tt>.  

	<h2> Mixed X Environments</h2>
	The Makefile and Imakefile that come with x3270 assume that you plan to
	run the x3270 client on the same kind of workstation as your X server.
	If you are running a mixture of X environments, such as a Sun XNews
	server and standard X11R6 libraries and header files, or using an X
	terminal, the supplied Makefile and Imakefile may not work properly,
	because then assume that your server and libraries are of the same
	type. This generally means that you will need to build and install the
	fonts separately, using server-specific tools.

	It is impossible to give comprehensive instructions here; however,
	here is an outline of how to do it:  
	<ul>
	    Copy all of the <tt>.bdf</tt> files from the x3270 directory
	    into a new directory, say <tt>XXX</tt>.    
	    <p><i>cd</i> into <tt>XXX</tt>.

	    <p>For each <tt>.bdf</tt> file, run the server-specific version of
	    <i>bdftosnf</i> or <i>bdftopcf</i> to create a <tt>.snf</tt> or
	    <tt>.pcf</tt> file. For example, for to build an NCD font on a
	    Sun-4, the command is: </p>

	    <pre><tt>   /usr/local/NCD/binSun4/bdftosnf 3270.bdf &gt;3270.snf</tt></pre>
	    Run the server-specific version of <i>mkfontdir</i>. For example:    
	    <pre><tt>   /usr/local/NCD/binSun4/mkfontdir .</tt></pre>
	    Then tell your X server to use this directory:    
	    <pre><tt>   xset fp+ XXX
   xset fp rehash</tt></pre>
	</ul>

	<h2>SCO Open Desktop 3</h2>
	x3270 requires the Athena Widgets library, which is available from
	sosco.sco.com.  

	<h2>Using an app-defaults File</h2>
	Earlier versions of x3270 required a separate <b>app-defaults</b> file.
	The app-defaults file contains definitions for options, text strings,
	fonts, colors, etc. The file allows x3270 to be reconfigured without
	recompiling by simply editing the file.  
	<p>Unfortunately, using an app-defaults file is a pain. The mechanism
	for finding the file is so flexible as to be almost incomprehensible,
	and it is difficult to run the program without doing a full
	installation, requiring root access to your system. Also, the
	app-defaults file generally changes whenever the program changes, and
	making sure that x3270 finds the correct app-defaults file
	compounds the above problems. </p>

	<p>Starting with version 3.1, x3270 no longer uses a separate
	app-defaults file. Instead, the file is compiled into x3270 itself.
	If however, you prefer to have a separate app-defaults file, you can
	compile x3270 to use it:
	<ul>
	    <li>For a color display, use <tt>configure
		--enable-app-defaults</tt></li>
	    <li>For a monochrome display, use <tt>configure
		--enable-app-defaults=-UCOLOR</tt>
	</ul>

	<h2>x3270-specific configure Options</h2>
	The <tt>configure</tt> script accepts the following x3270-specific
	options:
	<table border="3" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
	    <tbody>
		<tr>
		    <td><tt>--prefix=<i>prefix</i></tt></td>
		    <td>Install common architecture-independent files under
			<i>prefix</i> (defaults  to <tt>/usr/local</tt>).
			By default, this affects only the configuration
			files.
			In combination with <tt>--without-xmkmf</tt>, this
			affects all files.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td><tt>--exec-prefix=<i>eprefix</i></tt></td>
		    <td>Install common architecture-dependent files
			(executables) under <i>eprefix</i> (defaults to same as
			<i>prefix</i>).
			See the note under <tt>--prefix</tt>, above.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td><tt>--bindir=<i>dir</i></tt></td>
		    <td>Install common user executables in <i>dir</i> (defaults
			to <tt><i>eprefix</i>/bin</tt>).
			See the note under <tt>--prefix</tt>, above.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td><tt>--sysconfdir=<i>dir</i></tt></td>
		    <td>Install configuration files (<tt>ibm_hosts</tt>,
			character sets) in <tt><i>dir</i>/x3270</tt> (defaults
			to <tt><i>prefix</i>/etc</tt>).
			See the note under <tt>--prefix</tt>, above.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td><tt>--enable-app-defaults</tt><br>
			<tt>--enable-app-defaults=-UCOLOR</tt></td>
		    <td>Use a separate app-defaults file, instead of compiling
			one into the x3270 executable.
			With the <tt>=-UCOLOR</tt> option, builds for a
			monochrome display.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td><tt>--with-fontdir=/<i>full-path</i></tt><br>
			<tt>--with-fontdir=<i>relative-path</i></tt></td>
		    <td>Install fonts in an alternate directory.
			If the parameter starts with "/", it specifies the full
			pathname of a directory.
			If not, it specifies a subdirectory of the usual font
			directory.
			The default is <tt>misc</tt>.</td>
		</tr>
