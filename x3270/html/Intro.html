<H1>x3270 Introduction</H1>

x3270 is an IBM 3270 terminal emulator for X windows.  It can be used to
communicate with any IBM host that supports 3270-style connections over TELNET.
It can also communicate with hosts that use line-by-line ASCII mode to do
initial login negotiation before switching to full-screen 3270 mode.
<P>
It can use its own special fonts to fully emulate the special symbols
displayed on a 3278 or 3279, or any constant-width X font.
<P>
x3270 is a full-featured X client.  It participates in common X protocols,
such as cut-and-paste and the WM_DELETE_WINDOW and WM_SAVE_YOURSELF messages.
It is highly configurable and supports a wide range of keyboards.  A pop-up
keypad is available for selecting common 3270 function keys.
<P>
x3270 emulates one of four models of an IBM 3278 or 3279 terminal.  The
difference between the various models is the screen size.  The emulation is
not quite complete; x3270 understands extended field orders but does not
implement some of the extended attributes (outlining, extended validation,
etc.).  x3270 supports color displays in one of two ways: in 3278 mode by
displaying text with different attributes in different colors, or in 3279
mode by implementing the full color 3270 protocols.  It does not support
3179G bit-mapped graphics (GDDM).
<P>
x3270 supports the APL character set and several international character sets.
Many APL and international symbols are entered from the keyboard using the
"Compose" key and combinations of other keys.
