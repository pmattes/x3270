	<h1>c3270 Additional Build and Install Instructions</h1>
	<i>This file describes build and install information specific to
	c3270. For general build information, look
	<a href="Build.html">here</a>.</i>

	<h2>Wide Curses Requirement</h2>
	c3270 needs the 'wide' version of the curses or ncurses library (one
	that supports multi-byte character encodings).
	Without wide curses or ncurses, c3270 will be restricted to using the
	7-bit basic ASCII character set.
	<p>
	On some platforms, the standard curses or ncurses library is the wide
	version and no extra packages need be installed. On others, a special
	wide ncurses package is needed. On still others (such as on Solaris,
	documented below) the wide curses library is installed in a special
	location and <tt>configure</tt> must be told where to locate it using
	CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

	<h2>Notes for Cygwin</h2>
	Additional Cygwin packages are needed to compile c3270:
	<ul>
	    <li>The <b>libncurses-devel</b> package from the
		<b>Devel</b> group</li>
	    <li>For command-line editing and history, the
		<b>readline</b> package from the <b>Devel</b> group</li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Notes for Solaris</h2>
	<b>c3270</b> prefers wide curses, which on Solaris is in the
	<tt>/usr/xpg4</tt> directory. To use this version of curses, set
	CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS when running <tt>configure</tt>:
	<pre><tt>   ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/xpg4/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/xpg4/lib</tt></pre>

	<h2>c3270-Specific <tt>configure</tt> Options</h2>
	The c3270 <tt>configure</tt> script accepts the following
	c3270-specific option:
	<table border="3" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
	    <tbody>
		<tr>
		    <td><tt>--without-readline</tt></td>
		    <td>Don't use the <i>readline</i> command-line editing
			library, even if it is found on the system.</td>
		</tr>
	    </tbody> 
	</table>
