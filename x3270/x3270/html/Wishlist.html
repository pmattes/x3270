<H1>The x3270 Wish List</H1>

Here is a list of some of the more interesting suggestions and requests made
for <b>x3270</b>.
You may also take this as a list of functions that are definitely
not in this version of <b>x3270</b>.
<P>
There is no guarantee that anyone is actively working on these,
but feel free to yourself...
<ul>
<li>Support for the rest of the extended attributes: field outlining, extended
validation, etc.</li>
<li>Support for GDDM bit-mapped graphics.</li>
<li>Data-entry assists like local columnar tabs, automatic line wrap, etc.</li>
<li>A native Win32 port.  Note that c3270 already builds and runs under
 Cygwin, and that x3270 already builds and runs under Cygwin+XFree86.</li>
<li>RPM packaging.</li>
</ul>
